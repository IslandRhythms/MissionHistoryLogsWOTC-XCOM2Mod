This is the WOTC version of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2923170377] Mission History Logs [/url]

If you do not have the squad manager installed, the mod will default to "XCOM". Thanks to Rusty's Suggestion,
you can go into the MissionHistoryLogsWOTC.int file and change what you want the default to be.
The character limit is 11 as any more and it will bleed over into the next column. The mod checks for this,
so even if you go over it will prevent the bleed.

You can also thank Rusty for the CTD fix on Ongoing campaigns.

Also, this should support LWOTC. Let me know if it doesn't.
